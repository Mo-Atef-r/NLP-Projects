Speaker Identification Pipeline
Project Overview
This project implements a complete, end-to-end speaker identification pipeline utilizing a pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN deep learning model from the SpeechBrain toolkit. It focuses on identifying known speakers from audio inputs and robustly rejecting unknown or unauthorized individuals, forming the core of a voice biometric system.

Methodology & Pipeline Stages
The pipeline encompasses several critical stages:

Data Preparation
Meticulously filters and organizes audio files from the RAVDESS emotional speech dataset (Actor_01 to Actor_24). Splits data into distinct enrollment (training) and test sets for enrolled actors (Actors 01-06) based on specific criteria (e.g., statement, emotion, repetition). Prepares a large set of "unknown" (imposter) actor data (Actors 07-24) for robust imposter rejection testing, covering all statement 1 files with diverse emotions and intensities.

Speaker Enrollment:
Generates unique voiceprint embeddings for each enrolled speaker. This is achieved by extracting and averaging multiple embeddings from their designated enrollment audio files, creating a robust representation.

1:N Speaker Identification:
Develops a core function to identify a speaker from any new audio input. Compares the incoming audio's embedding against all enrolled voiceprints using cosine similarity. Applies a dynamically calibrated similarity threshold to make identification decisions (accept/reject).

Imposter Rejection Testing:
Performs extensive evaluation of the model's ability to reject unknown (imposter) speakers. Tests against a large, dedicated set of unenrolled actors (Actors 07-24) to quantify the system's robustness against unauthorized access attempts.

Key Findings & Achievements
High Imposter Rejection Accuracy: Achieved a remarkable 95.7% accuracy in correctly rejecting unseen and unenrolled actors (imposters) across a diverse set of audio files. Identified Model Nuances: Through detailed analysis, observed specific instances of potential confusion, notably between Actor 01 and Actor 23. This highlights areas for future model refinement or the need for more diverse enrollment data to enhance intra-class separation. Threshold Optimization Insight: Demonstrated the critical importance and practical utility of adjusting the detection threshold. This allows for strategic prioritization, such as minimizing False Acceptances for security-sensitive applications, even at the potential cost of slightly higher False Rejection Rates.
