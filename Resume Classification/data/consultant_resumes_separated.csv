80527194,"         LEASING CONSULTANT       Summary    Microsoft Office (4 years), Sales (4 years), Quickbooks (4 years), Performance Management (2 years),
Accounting (4 years), Market Research (4 years), Marketing Strategy (4 years), Marketing Communications
(4 years), Financial Analysis (4 years), Public Relations (4 years)        Accomplishments      To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Vincent Hall, and I hate the ""One-Size-Fits-All"" approach to business.  When marketing doesn't
feel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.  Gone are the days of the 1950's where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the ""lone
wolf"" and heroically conquer the ""Corporate Ladder"".  Similarly, business entities cannot survive the current
globalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, ""Corporate -Isolationism"".  A business, whether a
start-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with
its audience.  My interest in business started when my friend's step-father told me ""The only road to success is the one
you build through work and creativity"".  This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand
human behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics behind product positioning.  What about
the product makes it appealing.  How can a business increase delivery efficiency.  How does a business drive
up profit margins while driving down production costs?
In conclusion, between my experience in accounting, marketing research, marketing strategy, product
positioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key things.  First, individual's
desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.  It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds
or less.  Second, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.  In other
words, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options
to every customer.  It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will
assist in your company's profitability in product positioning.

Used Python - ""Random Forest Classifier"" to predict malignant tumors in breast tissue.  Here, main idea is building multiple models with different sample and different initial variables from train data set.  Goal is to determine what attributes provide the most information that can be used to predict malignancy.  My model was tested against “test data set” for accuracy and it is 96% successful in predicting whether the tumor is malignant or benign.   Data Mining- Image Classification:   It is the process to categorize images into one of several categories. Classification requires training for each image category.  Constructed Training and Test data for given image data using Java programming.  Constructed the five different classifier models using each training data file.  Tested these classifiers using test data and compared the prediction accuracies among five different classifiers. Achieved 95% accuracy.
